Tidier.jl is a meta-package in that its functionality comes from a series of smaller packages. Installing and using Tidier.jl brings the combined functionality of each of these packages to your fingertips.</p> <p>[GitHub] | [Documentation]</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#installing-tidierjl","title":"Installing Tidier.jl","text":"<p>There are 2 ways to install Tidier.jl: using the package console, or using Julia code when you're using the Julia console. You might also see the console referred to as the \"REPL,\" which stands for Read-Evaluate-Print Loop. The REPL is where you can interactively run code and view the output.</p> <p>Julia's REPL is particularly cool because it provides a built-in package REPL and shell REPL, which allow you to take actions on managing packages (in the case of the package REPL) or run shell commands (in the shell REPL) without ever leaving the Julia REPL.</p> <p>To install the stable version of Tidier.jl, you can type the following into the Julia REPL:</p> <pre><code>]add Tidier\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>]</code> character starts the Julia package manager. The <code>add Tidier</code> command tells the package manager to install the Tidier package from the Julia registry. You can exit the package REPL by pressing the backspace key to return to the Julia prompt.</p> <p>If you already have the Tidier package installed, the <code>add Tidier</code> command will not update the package. Instead, you can update the package using the the <code>update Tidier</code> (or <code>up Tidier</code> for short) commnds. As with the <code>add Tidier</code> command, make sure you are in the package REPL before you run these package manager commands.</p> <p>If you need to (or prefer to) install packages using Julia code, you can achieve the same outcome using the following code to install Tidier:</p> <pre><code>import Pkg\nPkg.add(\"Tidier\")\n</code></pre> <p>You can update Tidier.jl using the <code>Pkg.update()</code> function, as follows:</p> <pre><code>import Pkg; Pkg.update(\"Tidier\")\n</code></pre> <p>Note that while Julia allows you to separate statements by using multiple lines of code, you can also use a semi-colon (<code>;</code>) to separate multiple statements. This is convenient for short snippets of code. There's another practical reason to use semi-colons in coding, which is to silence the output of a function call. We will come back to this in the \"Getting Started\" section below.</p> <p>In general, installing the latest version of the package from the Julia registry should be sufficient because we follow a continuous-release cycle. After every update to the code, we update the version based on the magnitude of the change and then release the latest version to the registry. That's why it's so important to know how to update the package!</p> <p>However, if for some reason you do want to install the package directly from GitHub, you can get the newest version using either the package REPL...</p> <pre><code>]add Tidier#main\n</code></pre> <p>...or using Julia code.</p> <pre><code>import Pkg; Pkg.add(url=\"https://github.com/TidierOrg/Tidier.jl\")\n</code></pre> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#loading-tidierjl","title":"Loading Tidier.jl","text":"<p>Once you've installed Tidier.jl, you can load it by typing:</p> <pre><code>using Tidier\n</code></pre> <p>When you type this command, multiple things happen behind the scenes.

The fact that we were able to calculate each region's age also reveals that there are no missing values. Any region containing a missing value would have returned <code>missing</code> instead of a number.</p> <p>The <code>@chain</code> macro, which is defined in the Chain package and re-exported by Tidier, allows us to pipe together multiple operations sequentially from left to right. In the example above, the <code>ofp</code> dataset is being piped into the first argument of the <code>@group_by()</code> macro, the result of which is then being piped into the <code>@summarize()</code> macro, which is then automatically removing the grouping and returning the result.</p> <p>For grouped data frames, <code>@summarize()</code> behaves differently than other Tidier.jl macros: <code>@summarize()</code> removes one layer of grouping. Because the data frame was only grouped by one column, the result is no longer grouped. Had we grouped by multiple columns, the result would still be grouped by all but the last column. The other Tidier.jl macros keep the data grouped. Grouped data frames can be ungrouped using <code>@ungroup()</code>. If you apply a new <code>@group_by()</code> macro to an already-grouped data frame, then the newly specified groups override the old ones.</p> <p>When we use the <code>@chain</code> macro, we are taking advantage of the fact that Julia macros can either be called using parentheses syntax, where each argument is separated by a comma, or they can be called with a spaced syntax where no parentheses are used. In the case of Tidier.jl macros, we always use the parentheses syntax, which makes is very easy to use the spaced syntax when working with <code>@chain</code>.</p> <p>An alternate way of calling <code>@chain</code> using the parentheses syntax is as follows. From a purely stylistic perspective, I don't recommend this because it adds a number of extra characters. However, if you're new to Julia, it's worth knowing about this form so that you realize that there is no magic involved when working with macros.</p> <pre><code>julia&gt; @chain(ofp, @group_by(region), @summarize(mean_age = mean(age * 10)))\n\n4\u00d72 DataFrame\n Row \u2502 region   mean_age \n     \u2502 Cat\u2026     Float64  \n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u253c\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n   1 \u2502 other     73.987\n   2 \u2502 midwest   74.0769\n   3 \u2502 noreast   73.9343\n   4 \u2502 west      74.1165\n</code></pre> <p>On the other hand, either of these single-line expressions can get quite hard-to-read as more and more expressions are chained together.

These restrictions, while justified in some instances, can make interactive data analysis feel clunky and slow.</p> <p>A number of macro-based data analysis packages have emerged as extensions of DataFrames.jl to make data analysis syntax less verbose, including DataFramesMeta.jl, Query.jl, and DataFrameMacros.jl. All of these packages have their strengths, and each of these served as an inspiration towards the creation of Tidier.jl.</p> <p>What sets Tidier.jl apart is that it borrows the design of the tried-and-widely-adopted tidyverse and brings it to Julia. Our goal is to make data analysis code as easy and readable as possible. In our view, the reason you should use Tidier.jl is because of the richness, consistency, and thoroughness of the design made possible by bringing together two powerful tools: DataFrames.jl and the tidyverse. In Tidier.jl, nearly every possible transformation on data frames (e.g., aggregating, pivoting, nesting, and joining) can be accomplished using a consistent syntax. While you always have the option to intermix Tidier.jl code with DataFrames.jl code, Tidier.jl strives for completeness \u2013 there should never be a requirement to fall back to DataFrames.jl for any kind of data analysis task.</p> <p>Tidier.jl also focuses on conciseness. This shows up most readily in two ways: the use of bare column names, and an approach to auto-vectorizing code.</p> <ol> <li>Bare column names: If you are referring to a column named <code>a</code>, you can simply refer to it as <code>a</code> in Tidier.jl. You are essentially referring to <code>a</code> as if it was within an anonymous function, where the variable <code>a</code> was mapped to the column <code>a</code> in the data frame. If you want to refer to an object <code>a</code> that is defined outside of the data frame, then you can write <code>!!a</code>, which we refer to as \"bang-bang interpolation.\" This syntax is motivated by the tidyverse, where the <code>!!</code> operator was selected because it is the least-bad \"polite fiction\" way of representing lazy interpolation.</li> <li>Auto-vectorized code: Most data transformation functions and operators are intended to be used on scalars. However, transformations are usually performed on columns of data (represented as 1-dimensional arrays, or vectors), which means that most functions need to be vectorized, which can get unwieldy and verbose. However, there are functions which operate directly on vectors and thus should not be vectorized when applied to columns (e.g., <code>mean()</code> and <code>median()</code>). Tidier.jl uses a customizable look-up table to know which functions to vectorize and which ones not to vectorize. This means that you can largely leave code as un-vectorized (i.e., <code>mean(a + 1)</code> rather than <code>mean(a .+ 1)</code>), and Tidier.jl will correctly infer convert the first code into the second before running it. There are several ways to manually override the defaults.</li> </ol> <p>Lastly, the reason you should consider using Tidier.jl is that it brings a consistent syntax not only to data manipulation but also to plotting (by wrapping Makie.jl and AlgebraOfGraphics.jl) and to the handling of categorical variables, strings, and dates. Wherever possible, Tidier.jl uses existing classes rather than defining new ones. As a result, using Tidier.jl should never preclude you from using other Base Julia functions with which you may already be familiar.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#im-an-r-user-and-im-perfectly-happy-with-the-tidyverse-why-should-i-consider-using-tidierjl","title":"I'm an R user and I'm perfectly happy with the tidyverse. Why should I consider using Tidier.jl?","text":"<p>If you're happy with the R tidyverse, then there's no imminent reason to switch to using Tidier.jl. While DataFrames.jl (the package on which TidierData.jl depends) is faster than R's dplyr and tidyr on benchmarks, there are other faster backends in R that allow for the use of tidyverse syntax with better speed (e.g., dtplyr, tidytable, tidypolars).</p> <p>The primary reason to consider using Tidier.jl is the value proposition of using Julia itself. Julia has many similarities to R (e.g., interactive coding in a console, functional style, multiple dispatch, dynamic data types), but unlike R, Julia is automatically compiled (to LLVM) before it runs. This means that certain compiler optimations, which are normally only possible in more verbose languages like C/C++ become available to Julia. There are a number of situations in R where the end-user is able to write fast R code as a direct result of C++ being used on the backend (e.g., through the use of the Rcpp package). This is why R is sometimes referred to as a glue language \u2013 because it provides a very nice way of glueing together faster C++ code.</p> <p>The main value proposition of Julia is that you can use it as both a glue language and as a backend language. Tidier.jl embraces the glue language aspect of Julia while relying on packages like DataFrames.jl and Makie.jl on the backend.</p> <p>While Julia has very mature backends, we hope that Tidier.jl demonstrates the value of, and need for, more glue-oriented data analysis packages in Julia.</p> <p></p> <p></p>"},{"location":"#why-does-tidierjl-re-export-so-many-packages","title":"Why does Tidier.jl re-export so many packages?","text":"<p>Tidier comes with batteries included.

# ## Contribute to Documentation
# Contributing with examples can be done by first creating a new file example
# [here](https://github.com/kdpsingh/Tidier.jl/tree/main/docs/examples/UserGuide)

# !!! info
#     - `your_new_file.jl` at `docs/examples/UserGuide/`

# Once this is done you need to add a new entry [here](https://github.com/kdpsingh/Tidier.jl/blob/main/docs/mkdocs.yml)
# at the bottom and the appropriate level.

# !!! info
#     Your new entry should look like:
#     - `"Your title example" : "examples/generated/UserGuide/your_new_file.md"`

# ## Build docs locally
# If you want to take a look at the docs locally before doing a PR
# follow the next steps:

# !!! warning "build docs locally"
#     Install the following dependencies in your system via pip, i.e.
#     - `pip install mkdocs pygments python-markdown-math`
#     - `pip install mkdocs-material pymdown-extensions mkdocstrings`
#     - `pip mknotebooks pytkdocs_tweaks mkdocs_include_exclude_files jinja2 mkdocs-video`

# Then simply go to your `docs` env and activate it, i.e.

# `docs> julia`

# `julia> ]`

# `(docs) pkg> activate .`

# Next, run the scripts:
# !!! info
#     Generate files and build docs by running:
#     - `genfiles.jl`
#     - `make.jl`

# Now go to your `terminal` in the same path `docs>` and run:

# `mkdocs serve`

# This should output `http://127.0.0.1:8000`, copy/paste this into your
# browser and you are all set.
